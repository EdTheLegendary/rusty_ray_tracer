# rusty_ray_tracer
This project is the result of me following and completing Peter Shirley's [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).
Thanks to Peter Shirley for his amazing guide, I had a blast following it and porting the code from C++ to Rust.
